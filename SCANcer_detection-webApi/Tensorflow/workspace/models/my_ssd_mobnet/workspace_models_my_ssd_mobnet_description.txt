Here you should have your altered pipeline.config file. 
Original one should be in Tensorflow/workspace/pre-trained-models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320_coco17_tpu-8 subfolder (if you use default model)

After training checkpoints (trained model stage) will be stored and you should use it in your application

Basically thats the folder where all your results of training are stored/
